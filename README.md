BHSS G11 Computer science 2024-2025 sem1 Culminating project
this is Wes here speaking 
as you can see most of the code is Leon's work I am not gonna have any excuse for that,
the thing is I didn't do any work in the holiday so Leon work on the main code at that time
once I am back he already finish the bone of the game like it can already run on it's own
so mainly I am just focus on the bug fixing and the movement issuess that have left with 
I not gonna credit the bug fixing for meself cause it is not my work. (hope you not getting confuse with I spending days and do such little work)
